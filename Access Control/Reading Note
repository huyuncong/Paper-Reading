1.
	decentralized? access control? 	
	either for decentralized or centralized
		no need to restrict on decentralized
	
	<decentralized> paper refer decentralized to multiple key distribution center
	<crypto>	paper refer journaling mechanism
	<survey>	paper refer to Autonomous Delegation(except out of order)

	Server honest when expiry or revocation

	Cryptographic Access Control		distributed file system
		ACL, capability
	


2. 	Sieve
	just share data with service, so those service already got old data, and it's ok for 
		those service to read old data
	only the user can write new data
   	they are user-centric, user knows the service and service knows the user
		but we are resource-centric
	revocation need server to do re-encyprion and need server to be honest at that time

 	Sieve provides a way to manage master key using secret-sharing


3.	SFS
	Self-certifying File System
	access control list




my opinion
maybe we can add key management to make it more solid like Sieve

c. 	Cryptographic Access Control
		avoid the term of decentralized, autonomous delegation
		
b.	decentralized access control
		decentralized means decentralized key distribution center, and decentralized delegation and so on
		but need trust server in some degree(honest sometimes)

a.	End-to-End Encryption which can be used in access control either centralized or decentralized
